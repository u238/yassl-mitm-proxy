************* yaSSL Embedded Web Server Release 0.2 (2/4/2011)

This is the second release of the yaSSL Embedded Web Server (yasslEWS).

To build, type make and look for your platform, then type make again followed
by your platform, e.g.

$make
make (linux|bsd|solaris|mac|windows|mingw)
$make mac

In order to use SSL you will need to have the CyaSSL libraries available at
run-time.
SSL isn't required, the Web Server can be used without a secure port.

To build CyaSSL:
1) Download CyaSSL from http://yassl.com/yaSSL/Download.html
2) Unpack it,
    unzip -a cyassl-version.zip
3) configure it to use shared libraries and OpenSSL extra layer
    ./configure --disable-static --enable-opensslExtra
4) make it
    make
5) Install it
    sudo make install

The CyaSSL libraries will now be available in /usr/local/cyassl/lib .

To make sure the loader can find them you'll need to set the path.

Linux:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cyassl/lib

Mac:
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cyassl/lib

Then, to start the web server with both insecure and secure ports issue:

./yasslEWS -s server.pem -p 8080,8081s -e error.txt

Any errors will be available in error.txt.

Please see the manual in the doc/ directory for more information.
